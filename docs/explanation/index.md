## Framework Structure

`üêà mon` is designed to keep everything within the framework, including data,
libraries, scripts, and more. It works optimally with an IDE like 
__[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/)__, but can also be easily used in any 
console environment.

## Core API

`üêà mon`'s core API includes several packages built on top of 
__[Python](https://www.python.org/)__ and __[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)__.

| Package                                   | Description                           |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| __[foundation](mon/foundation/index.md)__ | Base functionality for other packages |
| __[coreml](mon/coreml/index.md)__         | Machine learning code                 |
| __[vision](mon/vision/index.md)__         | Computer vision code                  |

## Optional API

- `üêà mon`'s functionality can be extended by incorporating third-party code to
__[lib](explanation/lib/index.md)__ package. 
- Also, projects built on top of __[mon](explanation/mon/index.md)__, can be
  placed inside __[app](explanation/app/index.md)__ package for better
  management.

| Package                   | Description         |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| __[app](app/index.md)__   | Application code    |
| __[lib](lib/index.md)__   | Third-party library |
