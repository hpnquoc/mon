- **Put your model weights here.**

- Download pre-trained weights from a private server (required Resilio Sync):
  - https://link.resilio.com/#f=zoo&sz=3E10&t=2&s=C5SMNLEFP3XDINDX564OBW7BJ5FXTHHGGP3L4QF6NIPCZJ3OTBJA&i=CWFV52TYRPN3BSGPW3KSO3EXV53SEIFWM&v=2.7&a=3
  - When adding the "zoo" sync folder, link it to this folder.
  - Beware, this folder can be quite large.

- Recommend directory organization:
  ```text
  11-code
   |_ 45-data (dataset library)
   |_ mon
       |_ data
       |_ zoo (sync to this folder)
  ```
